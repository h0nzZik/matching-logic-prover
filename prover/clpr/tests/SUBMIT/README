Running benchmarks:
- Suppose the current folder is ~/CLPR/clpr-1.2b/Benchmarks/
- time ../clpr append.clpr

Note:
- You may have the following errors:
  + Fatal Error: no more code space
  + Fatal Error: Heap overflow
  + Fatal Error: Stack overflow
- To increase the code space, run with flag "-cs 1000000"
- To increase the heap space, run with flag "-hs 1000000"
- To increase the stack space, run with flag "-ls 1000000"

E.g. With insert_at_pos.clpr file, to increase the code space size,
we need to run with the following command:
  time ../clpr -cs 1000000 insert_at_pos.clpr
