\chapter{Define other logics and calculi\todo{Find a better title}}


The purpose of this section is to show that
many important logics and calculi can be naturally
defined/captured/subsumed
\todo{Find a better word.}
in matching logic as theories.

This chapter is organized in sections,
in each of which we discuss one logic or calculus.
In every section, we start by an overview of the
target logic, and then show how it is captured in
matching logic, followed by discussions and important
theorems about the definition.
