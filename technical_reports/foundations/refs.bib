    abstract = {Motivated by the verification of programs with pointer variables, we introduce a temporal logic  inlMMLBox  whose underlying assertion language is the quantifier-free fragment of separation logic and the temporal logic on the top of it is the standard linear-time temporal logic LTL. We analyze the complexity of various model-checking and satisfiability problems for  inlMMLBox , considering various fragments of separation logic (including pointer arithmetic), various classes of models (with or without constant heap), and the influence of fixing the initial memory state. We provide a complete picture based on these criteria. Our main decidability result is  pspace -completeness of the satisfiability problems on the record fragment and on a classical fragment allowing pointer arithmetic.  inlMMLBox -completeness or  inlMMLBox -completeness results are established for various problems by reducing standard problems for Minsky machines, and underline the tightness of our decidability results.},

@techreport{citeulike:3721776,
	abstract = {This note describes a separation-logic-based approach for the specification
and verification of safety properties of pointer-manipulating
imperative programs.We describe the approach for the C language.
The safety properties to be verified are specified as annotations
in the source code, in the form of function preconditions and postconditions
expressed as separation logic assertions. To enable rich
specifications, the user may include additional annotations that define
inductive datatypes, primitive recursive pure functions over
these datatypes, and abstract predicates (i.e. named, parameterized
assertions). A restricted form of existential quantification is supported
in assertions in the form of pattern matching.
Verification is based on forward symbolic execution, where
memory is represented as a separate conjunction of points-to assertions
and abstract predicate assertions, and data values are represented
as first-order logic terms with a set of constraints. Abstract
predicates must be folded and unfolded explicitly using ghost
statements. Rewritings of the abstract state that require induction,
or derivations of facts over data values that require induction, can
be done by defining lemma functions, which are like ordinary C
functions except that it is checked that they terminate. Specifically,
when a lemma function performs a recursive call, either the recursive
call must apply to a strict subset of memory, or one of its parameters
must be an inductive value whose size decreases at each
recursive call.
Assertions over data values are delegated to an SMT solver,
formulated as queries against an axiomatization of the inductive
datatypes and recursive pure functions. Importantly, no exhaustiveness
axioms are included in this axiomatization; this prevents the
SMT solver from performing case analysis on inductive values.
Combined with a measure to prevent infinite reductions due to selffeeding
recursions, this ensures termination of the SMT solver.
The time complexity of verification is unbounded in theory.
Specifically, since recursive pure functions of arbitrary time complexity
may be defined, there is no bound on the time complexity
of SMT queries. Furthermore, the approach, as currently implemented,
does not perform joining of symbolic execution paths after
conditional constructs; therefore, the number of symbolic execution
steps is exponential in the number of such constructs. However,
since no significant search is performed implicitly by the verifier or
the SMT solver, performance is very good in practice.
