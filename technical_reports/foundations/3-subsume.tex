\subsubsection{Syntax}

A $\lambda$-term is either a variable,
or an application $e e'$ where $e$ and $e'$ are $\lambda$-terms,
or a lambda abstraction $\lambda x . e$ where $x$ is a variable
and $e$ is a $\lambda$-term.
The set of all $\lambda$-terms is denoted as $\Lambda$.
A $\lambda$-theory is a congruence on $\Lambda$.

Let $\Lambda$ be the set of all $\lambda$-terms.
