`deductive_proof_system` contains some earlier research about matching logic proof system and separation logic.
`foundations` is the main technical report. 
`matching_logic_completeness` discusses a sound and complete (minimal) proof system of matching logic, with all proofs.
`mu_calculus_and_temporal_logic` defines various modal logic variants in matching logic.

The last two will be merged to `foundations`.
