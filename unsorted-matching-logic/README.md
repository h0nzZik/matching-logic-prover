# Matching Logic Prover

This ongoing project towards an automated deductive system (aka the mlprover) for matching logic [1]. We aim to machenize reasoning as much and efficiently as possible.

At present, the mlprover is in its prototype. The mlprover is developed in The Maude System [2].

## Prerequisites

Install The Maude System.
